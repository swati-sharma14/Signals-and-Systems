# Signal Analysis and Discrete Time Fourier Transform Visualization

Welcome to the "Signal Analysis and Discrete Time Fourier Transform Visualization" repository! ðŸ“Š

This repository contains Python code to analyze discrete time signals and visualize their Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). The code provides functionalities to plot signals, compute DTFT, and visualize various properties of the transformed signals.

## Signal-1: Unit impulse signal (x1[n])

In this part, the code computes and visualizes the DTFT of the unit impulse signal x1[n]. The unit impulse signal is defined as x1[n] = 1 for the value of n = [0] and zero otherwise.

The following plots are generated:

1. Signal x1[n]: The plot of the unit impulse signal x1[n] against the index n.

2. Real part of the DTFT: The plot of the real part of the complex DTFT signal, denoted as Re(X1(e^(jÏ‰))), where Ï‰ represents the frequency variable.

3. Imaginary part of the DTFT: The plot of the imaginary part of the complex DTFT signal, denoted as Im(X1(e^(jÏ‰))).

4. Magnitude spectrum of the DTFT: The plot of the magnitude spectrum of the DTFT signal, denoted as |X1(e^(jÏ‰))|. The magnitude spectrum represents the amplitude spectrum of the signal in the frequency domain.

Feel free to explore the code and modify the input signals or add additional functionality for further analysis. You can adjust the range of indices or frequencies to focus on specific portions of the signal or transform.

Enjoy analyzing discrete time signals and visualizing their DTFT! ðŸ“ˆ
