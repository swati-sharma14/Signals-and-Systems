# Decomposing a Signal into Even and Odd Parts

Welcome to the "Decomposing a Signal" repository! üîç

This repository contains code to decompose a given signal into its even and odd parts using mathematical operations.

## Signal z[n]
The `value(n)` function calculates the values of the signal z[n] based on specific conditions and mathematical expressions. By plotting the signal z[n] over a range of n values, we can visualize its characteristics and understand its behavior.

## Even Part of z[n]
The `evenvalue(n)` function computes the even part of the signal z[n] by applying symmetry operations. Plotting the even part helps us analyze its symmetry properties and identify any patterns or regularities.

## Odd Part of z[n]
The `oddvalue(n)` function calculates the odd part of the signal z[n] using symmetry operations. Plotting the odd part enables us to examine its asymmetric behavior and detect any distinctive features.

The code generates three subplots, each representing the original signal z[n], the even part, and the odd part. The stem plots provide a visual representation of the signal components.

Feel free to explore the code, modify the signal function, or adjust the range of n to analyze different signals and their decomposition.

Happy signal decomposition! üî¨
