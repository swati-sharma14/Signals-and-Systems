# Signal Convolution and Output

Welcome to the "Signal Convolution" repository! üîç

This repository contains code to perform signal convolution and compute the resulting output signal.

## Signal Functions
The code includes two signal functions:
- `value(n)`: Calculates the value of the first signal, x(t), at a given time t based on a mathematical expression.
- `newvalue(n)`: Computes the value of the second signal, h(t), at a given time t using a different mathematical expression.

## Convolution Operation
The code performs convolution between the two signals, x(t) and h(t), to obtain the resulting output signal, y(t). The convolution operation is computed by summing the product of each sample of x(t) and the corresponding time-reversed and shifted sample of h(t).

## Visualization
The code generates three subplots to visualize the signals and the output:
1. The first subplot displays the original signal x(t) over a range of time values.
2. The second subplot shows the second signal h(t) over the same range of time values.
3. The third subplot presents the output signal y(t) obtained from the convolution operation.

Feel free to modify the mathematical expressions, adjust the range of time values, or explore different signals by modifying the code.

Enjoy exploring signal convolution and the resulting output! üî¨
