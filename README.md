# Plotting Discrete Signals

Welcome to the "Plotting Discrete Signals" repository! 📈🔍

This repository contains code to generate visualizations for two interesting discrete signals.

## Signal x[n]
The `value(n)` function calculates the values of x[n] based on specific conditions and mathematical expressions. By plotting the signal x[n] over a range of n values, we can gain insights into its behavior and characteristics.

## Signal y[n]
The `newvalue(n)` function combines a cosine function with a unit step function to calculate the values of y[n]. By plotting the signal y[n] over a range of n values, we can analyze its variations and patterns.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to generate different plots. Adjust the range of n, modify the mathematical expressions, or apply signal processing techniques to enhance your understanding.

Happy plotting! 🌟🔬
