# Signals and Systems

Welcome to the "Signals and Systems" repository! ðŸ”¬

This repository contains Python code to analyze and visualize signals and systems. It provides a set of branches that cover different aspects of signal processing, system analysis, and Fourier transform visualization.

## Branches

### 1. Plotting-Discrete-Signals

The `Plotting-Discrete-Signals` branch focuses on plotting and visualizing discrete signals. It provides code to generate plots for various types of discrete signals such as unit step, unit impulse, and sinusoidal signals. You can explore this branch to learn how to plot and analyze discrete signals.

### 2. Decomposing-a-Signal

The `Decomposing-a-Signal` branch covers signal decomposition techniques. It includes code to decompose a signal into its constituent components using methods like Fourier series, wavelet transforms, or time-frequency analysis. This branch offers insights into analyzing signals by breaking them down into simpler components.

### 3. Signal-Convolution

The `Signal-Convolution` branch focuses on signal convolution, which is a fundamental operation in signal processing. It provides code to perform convolution between two signals and visualize the resulting output. This branch allows you to understand the effects of convolution on signals and systems.

### 4. Fourier-Transform-Visualization

The `Fourier-Transform-Visualization` branch specializes in visualizing the Fourier transform of signals. It includes code to compute and plot the Fourier transform, both for continuous-time and discrete-time signals. This branch offers insights into the frequency domain representation of signals and their transformation properties.

Feel free to explore the different branches and the code within each branch. You can learn about various signal processing techniques, system analysis methods, and Fourier
